That only pushes back that vacation to Hawaii.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have all experienced the</span> frustration<span style="font-weight: 400;"> of trying to understand an investment report, especially when it comes to the fees.Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But has anyone ever asked why they are being charged a 2% rate, instead of something lower?Â </span>

The main problem is that no one ever looks, so if you are still reading, pat yourself on the back.

You are doing the heavy lifting.
<h5>WHAT ARE FEES</h5>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The fees you pay are aggregated into what they call the net expense ratio. It is a percentage subtracted from the return of your account that is used to pay administrative costs, marketing, and other expenses. You pay for these fees no matter what, so make sure they are cheap!</span>

Even if we know exactly how much we are paying, we never know what other people pay. That obscures you from knowing if you are paying too much! That is how most people overpay for 401k retirement accounts and don't even know it.
<h5>HOW WE CAN HELP</h5>
So the burning question: Are you paying too much in comparison to other portfolios made up of the same assets?

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you know you are paying 2%, but you have no idea what others are paying. Thus, the information becomes irrelevant. However, if you know </span>Janice from accounting<span style="font-weight: 400;"> pays 0.80% on a similar account, you know you are at a disadvantage. What can you do?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You canÂ gain insight on this possible disadvantage on Vestivise. We save your time by automatically comparing the expense ratio you pay on your retirement account to what other people pay. That way, you can finally discover if you are in fact overpaying for your retirement account.</span>
