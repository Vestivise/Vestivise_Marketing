		<h1>Security</h1>
		<p>Vestivise is a secure platform for understanding investments and does not internally store sensitive information such as investment account login information or financial account numbers. User financial information is securely retrieved using industry-standard encryption techniques.</p>
		<p>Vestivise partners with industry leading data aggregation services.<br>
		Vestivise’s agreement with Quovo, Inc. is based around the following security specifications:</p>
		<p><b>Read-only Aggregation</b><br>
		The syncing technology has been built in-house to be safe, secure, and above all else, read only. The system is only capable of retrieving data from outside financial institutions and cannot execute trades or other transactions.
		</p>
		<p><b>Bank-level Security</b><br>
		Quovo's top priority is always the safety and security of your sensitive information. All transmissions between you and our servers utilize 256-bit SSL encryption, and we maintain rigorous server-side firewalls to make sure that no unwanted eyes are looking at your data.</p>
		<p><b>Extra Security in the Cloud</b><br>
		Quovo is hosted on the Amazon Web Services cloud, which provides us (and you) with multiple physical and virtual redundant data backup protocols, as well as some of the safest server centers in the entire world. Even better, AWS offers high computing power and availability.</p>
		<p><b>Internal Controls and Audits</b><br>Quovo undergo regular internal control audits and password/encryption key resets to ensure that our security isn't just safe, it stays safe. Quovo and Vestivise employees can never access sensitive personal user information.</p>
